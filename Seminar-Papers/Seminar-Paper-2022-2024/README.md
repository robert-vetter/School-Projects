# Automated Multi-Object Clustering using Machine Learning

This repository contains my seminar paper on **automating clustering algorithm selection with neural networks**. The project explores how machine learning can streamline the process of choosing the optimal clustering method for diverse datasets.

📄 **Paper Title:** _Automated Multi-Object Clustering using Machine Learning (in cooperation with Fraunhofer IIS)_
🔗 **Project Description:** [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@robertvetter793/revolutionizing-data-science-how-neural-networks-are-automating-clustering-algorithm-selection-477c05cf9888)
📂 **Content:** One Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), covering:
- Key clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, GMM, Hierarchical)
- Feature extraction for dataset characterization
- Neural network training for algorithm selection

💡 **Usage:** Open and execute the notebook to explore the methodology and results.

📝 _This work was part of my seminar project at Spezialschulteil des Albert-Schweitzer-Gymnasiums Erfurt._
